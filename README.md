# Barely

Barely is a console [notmuch](http://notmuchmail.org/) frontend heavily inspired by [alot](http://github.com/pazz/alot),
which is awesome, but slow.
Therefore it tries to be fast and simple while staying very customizable.

## Installation

Barely is written in Go. To install it, get a working Go environment and type

```go get github.com/laochailan/barely```

If you donâ€™t want Go to install stuff locally to your user directory, package it properly for your distribution.
